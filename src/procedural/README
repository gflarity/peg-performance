The solution in full does all 137846 games. The solution in symm takes advantage
of symmetry in the initial game state to half the number of games to run.
Notes on implementation are in the source.

The C solution in main takes ~1266ms
This full solution takes       ~18ms
This symm solution takes       ~12ms
With optimisations off, using gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) 4.6.1 and
